Seven of the top 10 teams all scored point totals this week that were within 6pts of each other.</p><p>It's becoming clear that if teams in the chasing pack want to catch the top 3, they will need to be braver and take more risks when choosing players and captains.</p>",

    "totwDescription": "<p><b>Yorkshire Lass UTD</b> edged out a very slight advantage over everyone else and picked up their second TOTW award, achieving the highest points total of GW7 with 79pts. Semenyo and captain Haaland provided the bulk of the points for the team, but the differential points came from the likes of Timber, Truffert and Mbeumo who all chipped in with assists. Well done Claire, and I thought you knew nothing about football üòâ</p>",

    "sackedDescription": "<p><b>Wards Wanderers</b> and their manager Scott have had a week to forget, scoring the lowest amount of points this week with 27pts and are currently rooted to the bottom of the table. A total of 4 injuries plus a player no longer in the Premier League has hindered progress for the team somewhat.</p><p>In the top half of the table, <b>Stranger Mings</b> will be cursing their inability to capitalise on their recent high-scoring performances in the last few weeks, dropping valuable points this week against the teams around them.</p>",
