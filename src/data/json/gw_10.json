They displaced <b>Norfolk N Chance</b> and <b>Yorkshire Lass UTD</b> who have moved down into 3rd and 4th respectively.</p><p><b>Try Hard FC</b> continue to maintain their lead, however they will be disappointed with their fairly average score of 64pts this week, giving some hope to the chasing pack.</p><p>The teams that performed well this week were the ones who gave the captains armband to Erling Haaland - scoring 2 goals against Bournemouth and picking up 13pts, or 26pts as captain. Some teams didn't fancy Haaland to do well against high-flying Bournemouth after blanking last week and opted for Newcastle's Woltemade and Bruno G who were playing a poor West Ham side - the risk didn't pay off however as the Toon went down 3-1 to the Hammers and Woltemade was subbed at half time.</p><p>It will be interesting to see what captain choices teams make next week with Man City facing their title rivals, Liverpool.</p>",

It is their first TOTW award of the season which is surprising considering they've been in and around the top 3 since the start. Goals for all 3 strikers and assists for Gabriel and Caicedo helped Jade's team move up to 2nd place. Well done Jade 👏🏻</p><p>Small shout out to <b>What's for pud..</b> who we're 16th at the start of GW10 and scored 83pts this week - more weeks like that and you'll soon be in the top 10.</p>",

With captain Thierno Barry blanking yet again and very little in the way of goals or clean sheets coming from the other players, it was a tough week for Charlie's team. Might be time to dig out that Wildcard 🃏</p>",
