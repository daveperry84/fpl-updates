It's still relatively close at the top of the table with only 41pts separating 2nd to 10th place.</p><p>It was a relatively low scoring week all round in comparison to previous weeks as some of the top PL teams and highest selected players came up against difficult opposition and Bournemouth and Newcastle were the only teams to keep a clean sheet.</p>",

We continue to bow down to your superior technical know-how Matthew üôåüèª</p><p>Josh and his team <b>Johnmcginnsthegoat</b> deserve an honourable mention. Josh decided to play his wildcard this week and achieved the second highest score of the week with 59pts after being the lowest scoring team last week üëèüèª</p>",
