We're talking about very tight margins in the fight for top 3 right now - with only 14pts separating places 2nd to 5th.</p><p>With everyone's perennial captain Haaland facing a rejuvenated Villa side this week, many managers didn't fancy him to do well this week - and rightly so as he blanked for the first time in 13 matches for club and country [UTV üíúü©µ - Ed.]. The most popular captain selections this week seemed to be Salah, Semenyo and Fernandes, however all 3 players failed to score particularly highly this week either. Dammit, should have captained Micky van de Ven, Joe Rodon or Zian Flemming of course ü§¶üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è</p><p>With 9 games played, we're roughly a quarter of the way through the season already üò±</p>",

I imagine Jack will be both delighted and relieved he played his Bench Boost chip this week after relegating this week's POTW van de Ven to the bench. In fact, his starting 11 only scored 2 more points than the 4 player sub bench, which makes the timing of the chip even more impressive. Bravo Jack, loving your work üî•</p>",

However, with no other clean sheets, goals and assists across the rest of the team and captain Thierno Barry blanking, it was a tough game week for Charlie's team.
