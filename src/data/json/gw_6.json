    "overview": "<p>The top 3 remains unchanged this week, however <b>Stranger Mings</b> had an excellent week which saw them gain ground on first place <b>Try Hard FC</b>, reducing the gap to 13pts. <b>Shadechester FC</b> remain in 3rd place, 28pts off 2nd place.</p><p>8 of the 20 teams used a chip in GW6, with 5 teams opting to use their wildcard. The silver bullet this week however seemed to be Triple Captain'ing Haaland, who scored 2 injury time goals, bagging him 16pts - or a massive 48pts for the 3 teams that did just that and ended up as the 3 highest scoring teams of the week.</p><p>Two of those teams were <b>Norfolk N Chance</b> and <b>Doggers FC</b> (who we have previously berated on multiple occasions for their player selections). Both teams moved up 5 places in the league, to 4th and 14th respectively.</p>",
    "totw": "<p><b>Norfolk N Chance</b> had an excellent week this week, scoring 81pts and netting their first TOTW award of the season. As mentioned above, playing the Triple Captain chip on Haaland netted James' team 48pts. Keeping faith in Ollie Watkins whilst many other teams offloaded him some time ago also paid off as he netted his first goal of the season against Fulham. Nice work James üï∫üèª</p><p><b>Doggers FC</b> specifically asked for a mention here for being the third highest scoring team of the week. So here you go Paul, well done for not being as shit this week üí©</p>",
    "potw": "<p><b>Omar Alderete</b> (SUN üî¥‚ö™ - ¬£4.0m) is player of the week for GW6, scoring 17pts. For a player with such a low price tag and only owned by 4.1% of teams, Alderete had an incredible match where he was involved in everything - scoring a defenders goal against Forest, keeping a clean sheet and providing 11 defensive contributions.</p>",
    "sacked": "<p><b>Pure Worship</b> had a pretty disastrous week, only scoring 20pts and dropping down 6 places to 18th. With Salah, Isak and Jo√£o Pedro blanking and no goals, assists or clean sheets across the whole team, it meant that not one fielded player managed to score more than 3 points. Hoping for a better week next time Doyle ü§ûüèª</p>",
