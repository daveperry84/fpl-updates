No injuries and no subs used, however zero goals and only one defensive clean sheet meant low points across the board.</p><p><b>Doggers FC</b> get a honourable mention finishing joint second last - it was certainly a bold strategy fielding Burnley's 3rd keeper and opting for an unproven 18 year old Brighton striker over Haaland.</p>",
