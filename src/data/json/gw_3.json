    "overview": "<p>All change at the top again as we have a new top 3 of <b>Try Hard FC</b>, <b>SmallTalkwithaSwede</b> and <b>Yorkshire Lass UTD</b>. <b>Try Hard FC</b> had a particularly good week (see TOTW) and they currently have a 27pt lead over 2nd place. It's still close as we go into the International break however, as 2nd through to 12th place are only separated by 28pts.</p><p>It was a week of surprises and upsets where player points were concerned, as players who previously were doing well, or who were expected to do well this week just didn't show up (looking at you, Chris Wood and Brennan Johnson). It was a relatively low scoring week as a result, with only 8 of the 20 teams scoring over 50pts and only 2 scoring over 60.</p>",

With a trio of Crystal Palace players (Gu√©hi, Sarr and Mateta) making up the spine of their team, all of who scored one each against Aston Villa, plus captaining Bruno Fernandes who scored against Burnley, you can't help but admire the foresight and planning that I personally seem incapable of (looking at you again Chris Wood üò°). Well done Matthew üëèüèª</p>",
